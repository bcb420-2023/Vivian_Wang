Create a 5 x 10 matrix of random integers,
and name the rows and columns

```{r}
set.seed(123)
m <- matrix(runif(50, 1, 100), nrow=5, ncol=10) 

# Define column names as cond1, cond2,..., cond5, ctr1,..., ctr5
colnames(m) <- c("cond1", "cond2", "cond3", "cond4", "cond5",
                 "ctrl1", "ctrl2", "ctrl3", "ctrl4", "ctrl5")

# Define row names as gene1, gene2,...
rownames(m) <- c("gene1", "gene2", "gene3", "gene4", "gene5")
```

Compute fold change in log2 ratios for each gene
by dividing the mean cond values by the mean ctrl values

```{r}
fold_change <- log2(rowMeans(m[, 1:5]) / rowMeans(m[, 6:10]))
fold_change
```
